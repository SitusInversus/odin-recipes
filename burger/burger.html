        <h2>Lets start with a list of potential upgrades to your burger</h2>
        <p>It's a given that you have made a plain well grilled patty and baked your brioche bun!
            Now a short list what u need!
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Tomatos, San Marzano</li>
            <li>fresh washed lettuce</li>
            <li>selfmade mayonese</li>
            <li>Ketchup and/or mustard</li>
            <li>a block of matured cheddar or a chunck of Epoisse</li>
            <li>finely chopped pickles</li>
            <li>caramellised onions, also chopped into small 5mm pieces</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Now all the magic is the way you stack it!</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Toast the inside of your buns, it has to be crispy</li>
            <li>Mayo on the inside of the bottom bun and ketchup and/or on the top bun</li>
            <li>now sprinkle the finely chopped pickles ontop of the bottom bun</li>
            <li>add the patty on top, followed by a layer of cheese</li>
            <li>if u took the cheddar, its time to melt it with a torch! stay professional! otherwise u can also take heated pan turn it upside down and place it on top of the patty</li>
            <li>now add the salad and garnish the tomato on top</li>
            <li>finally add the onions to the now sticky bottom side of your top bun</li>
